 End-to-End Data Engineering on Databricks – GlobalRetail Case Study
📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world, multi-country retail scenario, using Databricks to build an end-to-end data pipeline with the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). The goal is to optimize data flow, ensure quality, and deliver business-ready insights.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
•	Databricks (Community Edition)
•	Apache Spark / PySpark
•	Spark SQL
•	Delta Lake
•	Power BI
•	Azure Data Lake (simulated via DBFS)
🧱 Architecture: Medallion Model
•	Bronze Layer: Ingest raw transactional data (CSV/JSON/Parquet) into Delta format
•	Silver Layer: Cleanse, deduplicate, and transform data (handle schema, PII, nulls)
•	Gold Layer: Aggregate and model data for reporting (sales trends, product insights)
📊 Business Objectives
•	Build scalable, modular ETL across different geographies
•	Enable accurate reporting and trend analysis
•	Connect final output to Power BI dashboards for executive decision-making
📈 Features
•	Automated ingestion using Databricks notebooks
•	Delta Lake implementation for scalable storage
•	Business KPIs derived from Gold layer tables
•	Power BI connectivity for live dashboards
📁 How to Use
1.	Import notebooks into Databricks workspace
2.	Upload raw data files to DBFS
3.	Run Bronze → Silver → Gold notebooks in order
4.	Use Power BI Desktop to connect to the final Gold Delta tables
✅ Output
•	Curated datamarts
•	Optimized datasets for fast querying
•	Power BI reports with sales, region-wise trends, and category performance
🚀 Future Enhancements
•	Add data quality validation rules
•	Schedule daily jobs using Databricks Workflows
•	Integrate with real-time event streams or REST APIs
