Modern Data Lakehouse Architecture for Scalable, Multi-Country ETL
To handle complex ETL across 27 countries with varied data types and formats, a modern data lakehouse architecture is implemented with a multi-layered approach ensuring scalability (5+ years), flexibility, governance, cost-efficiency, and fast performance.
•	Raw Storage: Data ingested from sources into DBFS, S3, or Azure Data Lake.
•	Bronze Layer: Ingest raw CSV, JSON, Parquet files as-is for auditability.
•	Silver Layer: Apply cleansing, transformations, schema enforcement, and PII handling to produce quality-assured data.
•	Gold Layer: Generate analytics-ready, aggregated datasets (datamarts) for specific business use cases. Optimized for fast queries.
•	Reporting Layer: Power BI connects directly to the Gold layer for dashboards and reports.
Scheduling: Automated using Databricks jobs (hourly or daily).
